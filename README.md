# SpiderMan-Home-Page

A Spider-Man responsive page hero,about the game Spider-Man: Miles Morales, made with Jquery, some libraries (front-end), sass and html, totally focused on the front-end of the application. The project was done on the front-week of NÃ¡sser Yousef Ali, containing some changes and implementations of mine. The project does not need much more than some CDN imports in script tags and some js files already present in the same.
